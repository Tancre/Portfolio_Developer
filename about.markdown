Tancredi Di Giovanni is a researcher and theorist exploring the boundaries between art, science and technology in the attempt to dismantle them. Originally trained in design and visual communication, but profoundly discouraged by the economical factors compromising the discipline, he started to think of himself as a "nomad-by-necessity" in search for a not yet existing new field. In the meanwhile he is a web developer enthusiast for automation and a professional art technician building exhibition around the world.
